# Eleos

Eleos is a CAPSTONE project that tries to solve a common problem amongst young people who try to organize amateur football
games between themselves. As senior computer science students at the undergraduate level, it was a learning experience for us 
to apply what was learned on a real project. It was the first time that we worked on a project from the beginning to the end 
and come up with a complete solution to a real problem. Everything from design to implementation was done within 1 to 2 months time.
